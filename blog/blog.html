    <h1 class="blogTop">Welcome, I'm Matt</h1>
    <p>I love everything outdoors! The includes bike rides, tennis (which I'm not great at yet), shooting, bonfires, swimming, and oh so much more. I'm all about having fun. I love people. I love my family. I also love Web and Interaction Design!
        Most of all, I love the woman beside me in this picture. She's the love of my life, Katie. She's the prettiest girl around, has the funniest laugh and the cutest smile. She is the reason why I do the things I do. She motivates me to be a better
        me every day.</p>
        <p>
        A few months back I wanted to make a blog for a place to share what's going on in my life. I don't feel that social media was the right place for me. I wanted a place that I can share with those who care about me and want to know more aobut me.
        I hope you enjoy getting to know me better. I'm excited to have a place I can share my story. 
    </p>
